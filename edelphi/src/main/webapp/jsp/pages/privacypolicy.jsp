        <h3 id="h.3xywxnwe3xr7">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
        <p>
          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
          post a privacy policy. The law&#39;s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in
          the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
          Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
          information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:

        <h3 id="h.s1m8kqeyx36y">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of
          13 years old, the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
          Trade
          Commission, United States&#39; consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what
          operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&#39;s privacy and safety online.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not specifically market to children under the age of 16 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children
          under 16?
        </p>
        <h3 id="h.fpxxl178oxmd">Fair Information Practices and Rules</h3>
        <p>
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
          United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection
          laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented
          is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every person in the eDelphi user register has the right to check the information stored in the
          register and to request the correction of any incorrect information or the completion of incomplete information.
          Jere Lauha (<a href="mailto:jere.lauha@metatavu.fi">jere.lauha@metatavu.fi</a>) is the eDelphi controller. The
          controller will respond to the customer within the timeframe set out in the EU Data Protection
          Regulation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          An eDelphi user in the register has the right to request the removal of his or her
          personal data from the register (&ldquo;right to be forgotten&rdquo;). Data subjects also have other rights
          under
          the EU&#39;s general data protection regulation. Requests should be sent to the registry contact
          person/controller.
        </p>
        <h3 id="h.ho2x7z25vae6">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will
          take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h3>
        <p>
          Can change your personal information:
        </p>
        <ul class="c5 lst-kix_bqspv8gsguvq-0 start">
          <li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days</li>
          <li>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have
          the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
          law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
          individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
          data
          processors.

          and spells out tough penalties for violations.
